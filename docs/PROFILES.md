
The Beer Game: Key Concepts and Behavioural Profiles
## Introduction to the Beer Game
The Beer Game, also called the Beer Distribution Game, is a simulation developed at MIT Sloan School of Management during the 1960s. Contrary to its name, the game has nothing to do with drinking beer—it is a hands-on exercise in supply chain management.
The main objective of the Beer Game is to illustrate the “bullwhip effect,” a phenomenon in which minor changes in customer demand at the retail level become increasingly amplified as they move up the supply chain to the wholesaler, distributor, and manufacturer.
Throughout the game, players take on roles within the supply chain, striving to meet customer demand for beer while keeping both inventory and backlog costs as low as possible. Challenges arise due to delays and restricted communication, often resulting in significant inefficiencies.
## Main Roles in the Beer Game
There are four principal roles, each representing a step in the supply chain. Despite their different positions, each role shares a common objective: avoid stock-outs while minimizing inventory costs.
The Retailer:
The last link before the customer, the retailer sells beer to end-buyers. Retailers must manage their own stock and place replenishment orders with the wholesaler.
The Wholesaler:
Positioned between the retailer and distributor, the wholesaler fulfills orders from the retailer, but can only see the orders received rather than end-customer demand. To restock, the wholesaler orders from the distributor.
The Distributor:
As the bridge between the wholesaler and factory, the distributor fulfills the wholesaler’s orders, while placing their own with the factory to maintain supply.
The Factory (Manufacturer):
The starting point of the physical supply chain, the factory produces beer in response to the distributor’s orders. The factory’s position makes it especially vulnerable to demand swings caused by the bullwhip effect.
The Beer Game effectively demonstrates how each player’s rational but independent decisions—made with only partial information—can lead to collectively irrational results, such as severe overstocking and stock-outs.
## Key Behavioural Concepts
Several cognitive biases and decision-making patterns shape the way players behave in the Beer Game:
Anchoring: Relying too heavily on recent information, such as the last order, to make future decisions.
Myopic Optimization: Focusing solely on one’s own inventory and costs, ignoring the broader supply chain context.
Misperception of Feedback: Underestimating time delays between ordering and receiving goods, which leads to over-ordering.
Blame Attribution: Attributing supply chain issues to others (e.g., customers, suppliers), rather than one’s own decisions.
## Behavioural Profiles and Their Effects on the Bullwhip Effect
## Profile 1: The Aggressive Growth-Hacker
This type of player is primarily driven by a fear of running out of stock, viewing overstocking as an acceptable cost compared to lost sales.
Mindset: Avoid stock-outs at all costs. Overstocking is manageable; running out is catastrophic.
Ordering Strategy: Responds to any demand increase by ordering even more than needed, creating a large safety buffer.
Impact: Strongly amplifies the bullwhip effect by turning small demand fluctuations into major upstream order surges.
Reference: John Sterman’s research (1989) illustrates how players overestimate demand and ignore in-transit orders, fuelling the bullwhip effect.
## Profile 2: The Conservative Custodian
This actor is extremely risk-averse, prioritizing minimal inventory over the risk of stock-outs.
Mindset: Keep inventory as low as possible, even tolerating minor backlogs.
Ordering Strategy: Consistently orders less than received, dismissing demand spikes as anomalies.
Impact: Initially dampens demand spikes but eventually places large “panic orders” when shortages occur, causing violent demand surges upstream.
Reference: Schweitzer & Cachon (2000) examine how risk aversion leads to suboptimal inventory decisions.
## Profile 3: The Myopic Firefighter
This player lacks a consistent approach, reacting emotionally to crises as they arise.
Mindset: Feels beset by unreliable partners and unpredictable demand and acts reactively.
Ordering Strategy: Swings between zero orders and large, sudden orders based on immediate needs.
Impact: Introduces volatility and unpredictability, making demand patterns impossible to trace upstream.
Reference: Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang (1997) describe how misperceptions and irrational behaviors intensify the bullwhip effect.
## Profile 4: The Rational, By-the-Book Analyst
This player aims to be logical, using set formulas for inventory management.
Mindset: Bases orders on previous sales and target inventory, following a rational-sounding rule.
Ordering Strategy: Orders quantities based on last week’s sales plus the difference between current and target inventory but often ignores in-transit orders.
Impact: Despite rational intentions, this behaviour systematically amplifies the bullwhip effect by causing double ordering.
Reference: Croson & Donohue (2006) found that neglecting the supply pipeline leads to persistent bullwhip effects.

## Profile 5: The Stablizer or System thinker
Mindset: This player attempts to understand the entire system, not just their individual position. They recognize the impact of delays and try to counteract the bullwhip effect.
Ordering Strategy: Instead of reacting to single orders, they try to find a stable ordering pattern. They might intentionally place smaller, more consistent orders even when their direct inputs suggest a large spike is needed, aiming to smooth demand for their upstream partner. This is a proactive strategy to prevent the oscillations that reactive players create.
## Behavioural Profiles Linked to Specific Supply Chain Roles
## Retailer: The Signal Chaser
Retailers are closest to end-customer data and often overreact to perceived trends.
Role: Retailer
Mindset: Treats every change in sales as a significant trend, aiming to capitalize quickly.
Behaviour: Overreacts to random fluctuations, causing substantial demand amplification upstream.
Impact: Strongly initiates the bullwhip effect by misinterpreting natural sales variation.
Reference: Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang (1997) explain how overreacting to demand signals launches the bullwhip effect.
## Distributor/Wholesaler: The Passive Pipeline
Middle actors often feel powerless and simply pass orders along.
Role: Wholesaler or Distributor
Mindset: Acts as a neutral conduit, neither smoothing nor interpreting signals.
Behaviour: Matches upstream orders precisely to those received, magnifying any volatility.
Impact: Perfectly transmits panic or volatility received from downstream partners, worsening the bullwhip effect.
Reference: Cachon & Lariviere (2005) discuss how local incentives encourage this pass-through behaviour.
## Factory: The Production Smoother
The factory focuses on stable, efficient production rather than responding to every demand spike.
Role: Factory/Manufacturer
Mindset: Prioritizes steady production to avoid costly start-stop cycles.
Behaviour: Ignores sudden order surges and maintains a consistent pace, leading to inventory excesses or shortages.
Impact: Eventually creates large mismatches between supply and demand, culminating in inventory pileups or severe stock-outs.
Reference: Baganda & Cohen (1998) show how production smoothing can stabilize factories but destabilize the broader supply chain.
## Behavioural Economics Concepts in the Beer Game
The Beer Game vividly illustrates how cognitive biases, as explored in behavioral economics, shape decision-making within supply chains. Time delays, limited information, and decision pressure combine to amplify these biases, often overriding rational approaches.
Loss Aversion - Proposed by Kahneman and Tversky, loss aversion refers to the tendency to experience losses more intensely than equivalent gains. In the Beer Game, facing a stock-out is far more distressing than the gradual cost of holding excess inventory. This strong aversion to loss prompts players to over-order as insurance, fueling volatility throughout the supply chain.
Reference: Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1979). Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk. Econometrica, 47(2), 263–291.
Recency Bias - Recency bias causes individuals to prioritize the latest information, often at the expense of long-term trends. In the Beer Game, players heavily rely on the most recent order received, reacting strongly to sudden spikes even if long-term averages remain unchanged. This tendency drives short-term volatility and impedes stable supply chain management.
Confirmation Bias - Confirmation bias leads people to interpret new information in ways that support their existing beliefs. In the context of the Beer Game, once a player expects a boom, they treat large orders as evidence of that trend, dismissing conflicting data. This resistance to change prolongs and intensifies the bullwhip effect.
Herd Behavior (Social Proof) -,Herd behavior occurs when participants mimic others, assuming those actions are based on better information. For example, wholesalers may interpret large retailer orders as signals of hidden market shifts, prompting them to place similarly large orders. This chain reaction amplifies irrationality and pushes volatility upstream.
Overconfidence Effect -  describes how individuals often overestimate their judgment accuracy. In the Beer Game, this leads to players disregarding reliable ordering rules in favor of “gut feelings,” causing erratic and unpredictable order patterns that exacerbate supply chain instability.
## Connecting Biases to Behavioral Profiles
The biases above directly shape the archetypal behaviors observed in the Beer Game:
Aggressive Growth-Hacker - This profile is marked by a strong fear of stock-outs (loss aversion), a tendency to see every large order as confirmation of sustained growth (confirmation bias), and a belief in their ability to predict market trends (overconfidence).
Myopic Firefighter (Panicked Reactor) - Decisions here are driven almost solely by the most recent events (recency bias) and by the pain of recent losses, whether from stock-outs or overstocking (loss aversion). Blaming others for problems perpetuates short-term, erratic decision-making.
Signal Chaser (Retailer) - This archetype places too much emphasis on last week's sales (recency bias) and finds patterns in random fluctuations (apophenia/patternicity), leading to overreaction to typical demand noise.
Passive Pipeline (Wholesaler/Distributor) - These players mimic the actions of their partners (herd behavior/social proof) and opt for simple “good enough” solutions (satisficing), forwarding orders without deeper analysis.
These behavioral profiles reflect the practical consequences of cognitive biases. The concepts from behavioral economics are the underlying “ingredients,” while the profiles are the observable “recipes” that emerge during high-pressure play in the Beer Game. The profiles clarify what players do, and the biases reveal why they make those choices.




## What Else
The Beer Game is used as a flexible simulation tool to explore many other supply chain concepts, including:
Information Sharing and Transparency: A major area of study involves altering the game rules to allow players to see information from other positions, such as the retailer's end-customer demand. These studies consistently show that sharing real-time data dramatically reduces the bullwhip effect and improves overall performance.
Impact of Lead Times: Researchers modify the built-in shipping and production delays to study how lead time variability and length affect the supply chain's stability.
Collaboration and Team Dynamics: The game is used to demonstrate the value of collaboration, trust, and shared incentives among supply chain partners.
AI and Optimal Policies: A modern branch of research involves replacing human players with artificial intelligence agents. These studies aim to determine the mathematically optimal ordering strategy (often a "base-stock" policy) and use machine learning to see how an AI can learn to play rationally, even when teamed up with irrational human players.
Supply Chain Disruptions: Modified versions of the game introduce unexpected events, like a factory shutdown or a sudden shipping delay, to teach managers how to build resilience and plan for disruptions.
